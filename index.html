    <p>Topological Address Embedding for Blockchain</p>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>The rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin has not only increased trade volumes but also broadened the use of graph machine learning techniques, such as address embeddings, to analyze transactions and decipher user patterns. Traditional detection methods rely on simple heuristics and extensive data gathering, while more advanced Graph Neural Networks encounter challenges such as scalability, poor interpretability, and label scarcity in massive blockchain transaction networks.</p>
    <p>To overcome the computational and interpretability limitations of existing techniques, we introduce a topological approach, Chainlet Orbits, which embeds blockchain addresses by leveraging their topological characteristics in temporal transactions. We employ our innovative address embeddings to investigate financial behavior and e-crime in the Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum networks, focusing on distinctive substructures that arise from user behavior. In node classification experiments, our model demonstrates exceptional performance when compared to GNN-based approaches. Furthermore, our approach embeds all daily nodes of the largest blockchain transaction network, Bitcoin, and creates explainable machine learning models in less than 17 minutes, which takes days for GNN-based approaches.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The success of Bitcoin has driven significant blockchain adoption, creating networks with enormous data volumes and increasing analytical challenges. Blockchain transaction networks can be modeled as directed, weighted graphs where Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer strong embeddings but face scalability and interpretability issues.</p>
    <p>Chainlet Orbits addresses these problems by introducing a topological approach that embeds blockchain addresses based on their structural roles within transaction subgraphs. Unlike GNNs, Chainlet Orbits deliver interpretable embeddings efficiently, making them applicable to massive transaction datasets. Key use cases include detecting e-crime patterns like ransomware operations and financial fraud, with results showing exceptional accuracy.</p>
