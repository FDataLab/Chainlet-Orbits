    <h1>Chainlet Orbits</h1>
    <p>Topological Address Embedding for Blockchain</p>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>We propose Chainlet Orbits, a novel approach for embedding blockchain addresses by leveraging their structural role in transaction graphs. This method enables compact and interpretable embeddings, significantly outperforming Graph Neural Networks in scalability and node classification tasks.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The success of Bitcoin has driven significant blockchain adoption, creating networks with enormous data volumes and increasing analytical challenges. Blockchain transaction networks can be modeled as directed, weighted graphs where Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer strong embeddings but face scalability and interpretability issues.</p>
    <p>Chainlet Orbits addresses these problems by introducing a topological approach that embeds blockchain addresses based on their structural roles within transaction subgraphs. Unlike GNNs, Chainlet Orbits deliver interpretable embeddings efficiently, making them applicable to massive transaction datasets. Key use cases include detecting e-crime patterns like ransomware operations and financial fraud, with results showing exceptional accuracy.</p>
