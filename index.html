    <h1>Chainlet Orbits: Topological Address Embedding for Blockchain</h1>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>The rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin has not only increased trade volumes but also broadened the use of graph machine learning techniques, such as address embeddings, to analyze transactions and decipher user patterns. Traditional detection methods rely on simple heuristics and extensive data gathering, while more advanced Graph Neural Networks encounter challenges such as scalability, poor interpretability, and label scarcity in massive blockchain transaction networks.</p>
    <p>To overcome the computational and interpretability limitations of existing techniques, we introduce a topological approach, Chainlet Orbits, which embeds blockchain addresses by leveraging their topological characteristics in temporal transactions. We employ our innovative address embeddings to investigate financial behavior and e-crime in the Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum networks, focusing on distinctive substructures that arise from user behavior. In node classification experiments, our model demonstrates exceptional performance when compared to GNN-based approaches. Furthermore, our approach embeds all daily nodes of the largest blockchain transaction network, Bitcoin, and creates explainable machine learning models in less than 17 minutes, which takes days for GNN-based approaches.</p>

    <h2>Chainlets and Orbits</h2>
    <p>The temporal position of an address node within a directed transaction graph determines its structural role, referred to as an <em>orbit</em>, which can be leveraged in supervised learning tasks. Our primary objective is to establish these roles and utilize them in graph machine learning models. Orbits apply to UTXO blockchains naturally because a one-time-use-only transaction appears in the heterogeneous graph as a node, which allows ordering address nodes. For this reason, we use UTXO networks to define orbits. We extend our definition to account-based blockchains by using the temporal order.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="figs/rsMostFreqpattern.png" alt="Directed Bitcoin Network Graph" style="width: 60%;">
        <figcaption>By analyzing transaction patterns within the directed Bitcoin network, we identify specific address behaviors (circular nodes) in transactions (rectangular nodes), assigning structural roles as orbits. An e-crime address (red, striped) demonstrates orbits 9, 13, and 14, typical for ransomware transactions.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>We model the UTXO network with a graph \( G = (V, E, B) \) from a set of transactions \( TX \) and input and output addresses in \( TX \).</p>
    <p>On \( G \), \( V \) is a set of nodes, and \( E \subseteq V \times V \) is a set of edges. \( B = \{ \textbf{Address}, \textbf{Transaction} \} \) represents the set of node types. A node \( u \in V \) has a node type \( \phi(u) \in B \).</p>
    <p>For each edge \( e_{uv} \in E \) between adjacent nodes \( u \) and \( v \), we have \( \phi(u) \neq \phi(v) \). In other words, there is no edge between the same node types (Transaction → Transaction or Address → Address), and an edge \( e \in E \) represents a coin transfer between an address node and a transaction node.</p>

    <p><strong>Chainlets.</strong> Chainlets have been introduced to define position-invariant versions of transaction patterns. The key idea of the chainlet approach is to offer a lossless summary of all transactions by assigning two indices \( i, o \) in the \([0, n]\) range to each transaction with respect to its input and output addresses. A Bitcoin subgraph \( G' = (V', E', B) \) is a <em>subgraph</em> of \( G \), if \( V' \subseteq V \) and \( E' \subseteq E \). If \( G' = (V', E', B) \) is a subgraph of \( G \) and \( E' \) contains all edges \( e_{uv} \in E \) such that \( (u, v) \in V' \), then \( G' \) is called an <em>induced subgraph</em> of \( G \). Two graphs \( G' = (V', E', B) \) and \( G'' = (V'', E'', B) \) are called <em>isomorphic</em> if there exists a bijection \( h: V' \to V'' \) such that all node pairs \( u, v \in V' \) are adjacent in \( G' \) if and only if \( h(u) \) and \( h(v) \) are adjacent in \( G'' \).</p>

    <p><strong>\( k \)-chainlet.</strong> Let \( k \)-chainlet \( C_k \) in \( G \) be the subgraph of \( G \) containing \( k \) subsequent transaction nodes, all output nodes of these \( k \) transaction nodes, and all input nodes of the first transaction.</p>

    <p>A 1-chainlet lists a transaction node with its input and output addresses. Figure 2 shows a 2-chainlet; transactions \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \) share the common address \( a_1 \). A \( k \)-chainlet where \( k > 1 \) has a natural ordering of transactions because transactions are ordered in blocks, which, in turn, are ordered in a blockchain. This natural order allows us to assign roles to an address depending on where the address appears in a 2-chainlet. In the next section, we will count address roles and list them as address orbits.</p>

    <p><strong>Chainlet Classes.</strong> Let \( A_k(G) \) be the set of all \( k \)-chainlets in \( G \). For a given \( k \)-chainlet \( C_k \in A_k(G) \), the equivalence class of \( C_k \), \( E(C_k) \), is the set of all isomorphic copies (occurrences) of \( C_k \) in \( A_k \).</p>

    <p>Having defined equivalence classes of chainlets, we next define an equivalence class of address nodes for a fixed chainlet class.</p>

    <p><strong>Orbit of an Address Node.</strong> Let \( C_k \) be a \( k \)-chainlet in \( G \), and \( u \) be an address node in \( C_k \). We define the orbit of \( u \) with respect to \( C_k \) as the collection of the images \( \phi(u) \) where \( \phi \) is an isomorphism from \( C_k \) to another \( k \)-chainlet \( C'_k \) in \( G \), i.e.,</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\( O_u = \{ \phi(u) \} \).</p>

    <p>We use the notation \( o \) to refer to orbits, e.g., \( o_{15} \) for the orbit 15.</p>

    <h2>Active and Passive Orbits</h2>
    <p>We define an orbit as active or passive based on the role of the associated address within a 2-chainlet.</p>
    <p><strong>Active Orbit.</strong> Let \( C \) be a 2-chainlet. An active orbit with respect to \( C \) is an orbit where its addresses appear as the output of the first and the input of the second transaction in the corresponding occurrence of \( C \). When \( C \) is understood, we denote the set of active orbits as \( O_{\text{act}} \).</p>
    <p>Active orbits indicate behavior created by the address owner, as the address in this orbit initiates a new transaction and sends coins to other addresses.</p>

    <p><strong>Passive Orbit.</strong> Let \( C \) be a 2-chainlet. A passive orbit with respect to \( C \) is an orbit where it appears as the output of the first or the second transaction but not as an input of the second transaction in the corresponding occurrence of \( C \). When \( C \) is understood, we denote the set of passive orbits as \( O_{\text{pass}} \).</p>
    <p>Unlike active orbits, passive orbits for a chainlet class \( E(C) \) receive coins without shaping any occurrences of \( C \), as the address in this orbit only receives coins from another address without initiating a new transaction. It is worth noting that an address can belong to an active orbit for one chainlet class while belonging to a passive orbit for a different chainlet class. This means that an address may exhibit both initiating and receiving behavior in different 2-chainlet types. The below figure provides sample active and passive orbit addresses
in 2-chainlets.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="figs/fig3.png" alt="Active and Passive Orbits Example" style="width: 80%;">
        <figcaption>Sample active and passive orbit addresses in 2-chainlets. Active orbits (striped) show addresses initiating transactions, while passive orbits (checkered) only receive coins.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The distinction between active and passive orbits is significant for analyzing specific behaviors within the transaction graph. Active orbits help train classifiers to identify spending patterns, such as paying for ransom, as they reflect behavior initiated by the address owner. Conversely, passive orbits are useful for examining receiving behaviors.</p>

        <h2>Experimental Setup</h2>
    <p><strong>Datasets.</strong> We extract data from the Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum transaction networks.</p>
    <p><strong>Bitcoin Transaction Network.</strong> We have downloaded and analyzed the complete Bitcoin transaction graph from its inception in 2009 by utilizing the Bitcoin Core Wallet and the <a href="https://github.com/blockchain-etl/bitcoin-etl">Bitcoin-ETL library</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>BitcoinHeist Addresses.</strong> Our ransomware dataset is a union of datasets from three widely adopted studies: Montreal, Princeton, and Padua. The combined dataset contains addresses from 27 ransomware families. A total of 19,930 unique ransomware addresses appear 62,641 times since 2009.</p>
    <p><strong>Bitcoin Darknet Addresses.</strong> We downloaded the Grams dataset from the Darknet Market Archives. This dataset spans from June 9, 2014, to July 12, 2015. We identified 7,557 unique addresses associated with transactions from darknet marketplaces, totaling 1,288,100 occurrences.</p>
    <p><strong>Ethereum Transaction Network.</strong> The complete Ethereum transaction graph was downloaded and analyzed from its inception in 2015 using the Geth Wallet and the <a href="https://github.com/blockchain-etl/ethereum-etl">Ethereum-ETL library</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Ethereum DeFi Addresses.</strong> Our DeFi dataset consists of lending, asset, derivative, and decentralized exchange addresses. The combined dataset contains 1,407 addresses, appearing a total of 108 million times since 2015.</p>
    <p><strong>Litecoin Transaction Network.</strong> We downloaded and analyzed the complete Litecoin transaction graph from its inception in 2011 using the Litecoin Core Wallet and RPC calls.</p>
    <p><strong>Hardware.</strong> We ran experiments on a single Dell PowerEdge R630, featuring an Intel Xeon E5-2650 v3 Processor (10 cores, 2.30 GHz, 20MB Cache), and 192GB of RAM (DDR4-2133MHz).</p>
    <p><strong>Preprocessing.</strong> We did not apply any normalization or preprocessing. Extracting orbits is computationally efficient, enabling the entire transaction network to be used without removing any edges or nodes.</p>
    <p>We made the full address orbits, which are 27 GB in size, publicly available at <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/Chainlet/Blockchain_Orbits">Huggingface Blockchain Orbits</a>. Classifier data is also provided there.</p>
    <p><strong>Computational Complexity.</strong> Extracting a 2-chainlet requires three searches on the adjacency matrix. The first step involves finding all transaction nodes, costing \( O(V) \). The second step, which searches for address nodes shared between transaction pairs, has a complexity of \( O(V^3) \). However, because 57.40% of Bitcoin transactions have fewer than two input and output addresses, the complexity is effectively reduced to \( k \times O(V^2) \), where \( k \approx 2 \).</p>
    <p>As shown in the below figure, on the majority of days, orbit extraction is completed within 1,000 seconds (less than 17 minutes).</p>

        <figcaption>Orbit discovery time costs from the daily Bitcoin transaction graph. Each data point denotes a specific day.</figcaption>
    </figure>

        <h2>Experimental Results</h2>
    <p>We apply orbit discovery to the Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum blockchains. As ground truth address labels are predominantly available for the Bitcoin network, we primarily focus on the Bitcoin transaction network and detail our findings in this section. Results for Ethereum and Litecoin are also discussed in the appendices.</p>

    <h3>Heuristics</h3>
    <p>We employ co-spending and transition heuristics with all historical ransomware addresses. This leads to the discovery of 40 unique addresses associated with well-known ransomware families such as CryptoLocker, CryptoWall, and CryptoTorLocker. These low numbers suggest that researchers had previously expanded these datasets using similar heuristics.</p>

    <h3>Orbits on the BitcoinHeist Benchmark</h3>
    <p>We use orbits of Bitcoin addresses in a binary (white vs. ransomware) node classification task on the BitcoinHeist dataset. The dataset includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2,916,697 ransomware and white addresses</li>
        <li>1,048,576 transactions from January 2009 to December 2018</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Transactions with amounts less than 0.3 BTC were excluded, as ransomware payments are typically larger. For classification, we use a Random Forest model with 300 trees and an 80/20 train/test split.</p>
    <p><strong>Results.</strong> The following table compares the AUC scores for address classification:</p>
    <table border="1" style="width: 60%; margin: 20px auto; text-align: center;">
        <tr>
            <th>Sample</th>
            <th>BitcoinHeist</th>
            <th>Orbit</th>
            <th>BitcoinHeist + Orbit</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>50K</td>
            <td>0.807</td>
            <td>0.857</td>
            <td>0.908</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>100K</td>
            <td>0.808</td>
            <td>0.856</td>
            <td>0.908</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>500K</td>
            <td>0.798</td>
            <td>0.849</td>
            <td>0.903</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1M</td>
            <td>0.791</td>
            <td>0.839</td>
            <td>0.895</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The results demonstrate that orbits provide robust performance compared to BitcoinHeist features alone, especially in larger datasets.</p>

    <h3>Orbits on the Large Bitcoin Network</h3>
    <p>We evaluate the generalization of e-crime classification with a larger Bitcoin dataset, sampling 1% of the daily white addresses (3.16 million addresses). The labeled data includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1.28 million darknet market addresses</li>
        <li>64,000 ransomware addresses</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We employ a one-versus-rest Random Forest classifier with an 80/20 train/test split. Figure 5 shows consistent AUC performance exceeding 0.8, demonstrating the strength of orbit-based classifiers.</p>

    <h4>Active and Passive Orbits</h4>
    <p>We analyze the role of orbit types (active vs. passive) in detecting e-crime payments. Table 3 summarizes the macro-averaged AUC performance:</p>
    <table border="1" style="width: 60%; margin: 20px auto; text-align: center;">
        <tr>
            <th>Class</th>
            <th>Active Orbits AUC</th>
            <th>Passive Orbits AUC</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>White</td>
            <td>0.731</td>
            <td>0.870</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Ransomware (RS)</td>
            <td>0.725</td>
            <td>0.736</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Darknet Market (DM)</td>
            <td>0.727</td>
            <td>0.876</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Passive orbits yield higher AUC values compared to active orbits. This result suggests that studying payer behaviors (e.g., victims in ransomware and buyers in darknet markets) is particularly effective for identifying e-crime addresses.</p>
