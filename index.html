    <h1>Chainlet Orbits: Topological Address Embedding for Blockchain</h1>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>The rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin has not only increased trade volumes but also broadened the use of graph machine learning techniques, such as address embeddings, to analyze transactions and decipher user patterns. Traditional detection methods rely on simple heuristics and extensive data gathering, while more advanced Graph Neural Networks encounter challenges such as scalability, poor interpretability, and label scarcity in massive blockchain transaction networks.</p>
    <p>To overcome the computational and interpretability limitations of existing techniques, we introduce a topological approach, Chainlet Orbits, which embeds blockchain addresses by leveraging their topological characteristics in temporal transactions. We employ our innovative address embeddings to investigate financial behavior and e-crime in the Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum networks, focusing on distinctive substructures that arise from user behavior. In node classification experiments, our model demonstrates exceptional performance when compared to GNN-based approaches. Furthermore, our approach embeds all daily nodes of the largest blockchain transaction network, Bitcoin, and creates explainable machine learning models in less than 17 minutes, which takes days for GNN-based approaches.</p>

    <h2>Chainlets and Orbits</h2>
        <p>The temporal position of an address node within a directed transaction graph determines its structural role, referred to as an <em>orbit</em>, which can be leveraged in supervised learning tasks. Our primary objective is to establish these roles and utilize them in graph machine learning models.</p>
    <p>Orbits apply to UTXO blockchains naturally because a one-time-use-only transaction appears in the heterogeneous graph as a node, which allows ordering address nodes. For this reason, we use UTXO networks to define orbits. We extend our definition to account-based blockchains by using the temporal order.</p>

    <figcaption>By analyzing transaction patterns within the directed Bitcoin network, we identify specific address behaviors (circular nodes) in transactions (rectangular nodes), assigning structural roles as orbits. An e-crime address (red, striped) demonstrates orbits 9, 13, and 14, typical for ransomware transactions.</figcaption>
